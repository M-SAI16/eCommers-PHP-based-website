# Project Overview
This project is a simple yet functional eCommerce web application built using PHP and MySQL. It provides a basic shopping experience along with an admin panel to manage the product catalog. The frontend allows users to view products, and the backend enables admins to add, edit, delete, and manage products from a secure dashboard.
